# virtual-eye-mouse

In this project, an individual human computer interface system using eye motion is 
introduced. Traditionally, human computer interface uses mouse, keyboard as an input 
device. This paper presents hands free interface between computer and human. This
technology is intended to replace the conventional computer screen pointing devices for 
the use of disabled. The paper presents a novel idea to control computer mouse cursor
movement with human eyes It controls mouse-moving by automatically affecting the 
position where eyesight focuses on, and simulates mouse-click by affecting blinking 
action. However, the proposed vision-based virtual interface controls system work on 
various eye movements such as eye blinking
